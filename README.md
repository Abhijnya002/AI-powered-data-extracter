## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.dev/)
- Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

### Backend
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) API
- LLMs via [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
  - Local: `flan-t5-base`, `distilbart-cnn-12-6`
  - Deployed: `sshleifer/tiny-gpt2` (optimized for CPU-only hosting)
- Hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com)

### NLP Fallbacks
- Regex + zero-shot classification
- Graceful degradation when LLMs are not available

### Excel Export
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/) for Excel styling, categorization, and formatting
